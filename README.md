# bring-it

## Introduction
The project is based on a peer to peer market place, people in Pakistan can buy
imported products with very less amount charged as compared to that of duty
tax and a traveller will bring their product in exchange of some commission. So,
imagine you need a product which is not available in Pakistan, or there is huge
sale in some country from where you can easily get your product at good price,
for that purpose you would have to search for your family or friends that would
take some time or you have to go for shipment which is quite expensive. This
is where our services comes in help. We will connect the buyer with a traveller
agreed on an agreement.

## Objectives
1. To provide an easy to use application where the buyer can sign up, select
the country and then product they are willing to purchase .
2. The registered traveller with this application will receive the request from
company, with option to accept or reject the request, if the traveller accepts
the request then he have to pay a security deposit which he can take back
at destination.
3. The buyer will then send company the amount of product, the company’s
branch in the respective country would purchase the product for the customer and then assign it to the respective traveller.
4. The company would take 10% of the product price as their fees in which 6%
is the company’s charge where as 4% will be given to the traveller.
5. The company will also post some popular selling products on high sales on
the application.
